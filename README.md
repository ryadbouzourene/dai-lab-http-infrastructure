## Step 1: Static Web Site

The goal of this step was to create a Docker container running Nginx to serve a static website.
Below are the configuration files and the steps taken to achieve this.

### Configuration of `nginx.conf`:
```nginx
http {
    include /etc/nginx/mime.types;

    server {
        listen 80;
        server_name localhost;

        location / {
            root /usr/share/nginx/html;
            index index.html;
        }

        error_page 404 /404.html;
    }
}
```

### Configuration of `Dockerfile`:
```dockerfile
FROM nginx:latest

COPY src /usr/share/nginx/html

COPY nginx.conf /etc/nginx/nginx.conf

EXPOSE 80
```

### How to run the Docker:
To build the Docker image:
```bash
docker build -t static-website:latest .
```

To run it on port 8080:
```bash
docker run -d -p 8080:80 static-website:latest
```

To test it:
1. Open your web browser and go to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).
2. Verify that the website loads correctly.
3. Test the 404 page by navigating to a non-existent URL (e.g., `http://localhost:8080/hello`).

### Website Description:

The static website is built using a free template from Start Bootstrap.
It includes a landing page with placeholders for images and text, designed for a clean and modern appearance.

## Step 2: Docker Compose

To simplify the deployment of the static web server, we used Docker Compose.
Below are the configurations and instructions.

### Configuration of `docker-compose.yml`:
```yaml
services:
  static-web:
    build:
      context: ./static-website
    ports:
      - "8080:80"
    container_name: static-website
```

### How to run the Docker Compose:
1. **Build and start the service**:
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

2. **Stop the service**:
```bash
docker-compose down
```

3. **Test the server**:
Open your web browser and navigate to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)
to verify that the static website is running.

### Validation:
- The static website was accessible at `http://localhost:8080`.
- Changes in the website content can be easily integrated by rebuilding the Docker image using:
```bash
docker-compose build
```
